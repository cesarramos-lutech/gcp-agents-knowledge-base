# GCP Agents Knowledge Base

A personal knowledge base for learning and organizing knowledge about **AI agents on Google Cloud** -- ADK, Conversational Analytics API, multi-agent orchestration, and related topics.

## Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|:--|:--|
| `comparisons/` | Side-by-side comparisons of tools, approaches, and architectures |
| `concepts/` | Core concepts explained -- what things are and how they work |
| `experiments/` | Notes and learnings from hands-on experiments and prototypes |
| `decisions/` | Decision frameworks -- when to use what, trade-offs, recommendations |

## How to use this repo

This is a living document. The workflow is simple:

1. **Learn something** (from building, reading, experimenting, or conversations)
2. **Distill it** into a short markdown file
3. **Put it in the right folder** and update this index
4. **Push it**

Over time, this becomes a searchable, version-controlled second brain for the agents domain.

## Topics to explore

- [ ] ADK fundamentals (agents, tools, sessions, state)
- [ ] Multi-agent orchestration patterns (sequential, parallel, loop)
- [ ] Semantic layers and why they matter for NL2SQL accuracy
- [ ] BigQuery ML (BQML) agents for forecasting and anomaly detection
- [ ] Agent Engine (Vertex AI) for managed deployment
- [ ] MCP (Model Context Protocol) and tool interoperability
- [ ] Evaluation and testing strategies for agents
- [ ] Cost optimization for LLM-heavy agent pipelines
